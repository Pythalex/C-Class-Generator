#C++ Class Generator

This project is a result of an exercice from C++ Tutorial available on [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/programmez-avec-le-langage-c/tp-zeroclassgenerator) website.
The project is written in Qt 5.8 and you will need it to compile the project. Basically just create a project with Qt Creator with Qt 5.8. <br/>
For the moment, I joined an exe file with dlls that should run on pretty much every Windows versions, for those who can't compile Qt projects.

###What is it ?
As the name says, it's a class generator. Meaning it will generate an header output of a class for the user. Currently, it only generates a header output, but in the future I plan to add the cpp implementation and possibly the auto creation of the h/cpp files.

###What it looks like
